# Covid-Case-Study
I analyze a large dataset pertaining to the Covid-19 Pandemic.

In particular, I utilize two large, publicly available datasets pertaining to Covid Deaths & Covid Vaccinations. 

To analyze the information, I utilize SQL & Tableau. 

In SQL, I perform a variety of functions, statements, joins, creating custom columns, and perform calculations. 
To see exactly what I did & how I did it, refer to the SQL code file provided as well as the Word file write-up of the project.

I later transitioned my analysis towards Tableau to visually tell the story of Covid-19.
In Tableau, I created a dashboard, performed calculations, created visually-appealing and insightful infographics, 
and I performed a variety of advanced concepts like workbook formatting, calculated fields, etc. 
Please, refer to the Tableau Public link I have provided in the text file for further information.
